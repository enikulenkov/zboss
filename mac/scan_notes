Scan refactoring:
- to kill sync timer (used in ed scan only) - alarms became the only time mechanism
- to unite common parts and decrease code size

scan parameters:
- channels mask
- duration
- type

Scan types implemented:
- ed
  remember scan params (pending buf?)
  save current channel
  set beacon only mode
  loop on all channels masked by the channels mask {
       set channel
       until timeout loop {
         get rssi, rmember max rssi
       }
       assign rssi in the confirm
  }
  set saved channel
  set normal mode

- active
  remember scan params (pending buf?)
  save current channel
  set beacon only mode
  loop on all channels masked by the channels mask {
       set channel
       send beacon request
       wait for send complete
       until timeout loop {
             if have in packet, receive and parse it (wants beacons)
       }
  }
  set saved channel
  set normal mode

- orphan
  remember scan params (pending buf?)
  loop on all channels masked by the channels mask {
       set channel
       send orphan notification command
       wait for send complete
       until timeout loop {
             if have in packet, receive and parse it (wants coord realignment)
             if got coord realignment, break channel loop
       }
  }


common routine:

remember scan params
save current channel
set beacon only mode, if necessary
remember current channel
